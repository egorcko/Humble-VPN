          security. When you access our websites and use our best-in-class VPN

          provide and improve our products, send notifications and updates,
          troubleshoot, and to support our free product through advertising. Our
          goal is to be upfront about what we collect, how we use it and whom we
          share it with, and that’s why we've written this Privacy Policy. This
          Privacy Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with
          respect to your information, and how you can contact us if you have
          any questions or concerns. Below is a snapshot of some of our
          important privacy practices, but please read the full Policy for more

        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Overview</h2>

        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>
            Our VPN product will never store or log your IP address beyond the
            duration of your VPN session, and we always delete your IP address
            after you disconnect from the VPN.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not keep logs of your online activities and never associate
            any domains, or applications that you access while the Humble VPN is connected with you, your device, or your email.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Creating an account is always optional - we never require you to
          register or otherwise provide us any contact information to download
          or use our products While we always de-identify your IP address while
          connected to the VPN. Remember that no VPN provider can control what
          other apps collect from your device or what cookies other websites or
          third parties place in your browser. For more information about how to
          exercise choices with respect to certain third party cookies, please
          see the Third Party Advertising section below.
        </p>

        <h2>Security Overview</h2>

        <p>
          When the Humble VPN is connected, we encrypt all of the traffic
          between your device and our servers, using different secure
          algorithms. Your web traffic on unsecured networks such as public
          Wi-Fi at cafes, airports, etc. is always securely encrypted when the
          Humble VPN is connected.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers the free and paid versions of Humble VPN including the mobile and desktop applications, as well as the our
          websites, (collectively, the “Services”). The terms “Humble VPN”,
          “We”, “Us” and “Our” include Humble VPN, and our affiliates and
          subsidiaries. By using the Services, you agree to the terms and
          conditions of this Privacy Policy. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use
          of the Services is also subject to our Terms of Service. Separate from
          our consumer applications, Humble VPN licenses its technology to
          third party partners for integration with their applications. This
          Privacy Policy may also apply to our partner applications. However,
          this Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that We only process
          Personal Information on behalf of our partners as part of third party
          partner products. To learn more about the processing of your Personal
          Information in that context, please refer to the relevant partner's
          privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>
          For the purpose of this Privacy Policy. ”Personal Information” means
          any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.
          We obtain Personal Information relating to you from various sources
          described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you
          must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the
          consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal
          Information When requested, you may not be able to benefit from some
          features of our Services if that information is necessary to provide
          you with that feature of our Services. There are two basic categories
          of Personal Information we collect:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>Personal Information you choose to give us</li>
          <li>
            Personal Information we automatically collect When you use our
            Services
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You can be assured that the Personal Information We may collect,
          including your email, IP address, username, or unique mobile ID is
          never associated with any online activities you engage in while the
          Humble VPN is connected. Additionally, when the Humble VPN
          is connected, your IP address is stored in encrypted format for the
          duration of the session and is deleted after you disconnect from the
          VPN.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information You Choose To Give Us</h2>
        <p>
          When you interact with our Services, we collect the Personal
          Information that you choose to share with us. For example, if you
          purchase a subscription to Humble VPN's premium plans, and/or
          sign up to create an account, you may provide us with an email address
          and payment information. Remember that creating an account is always
          optional - we never require you to register or otherwise provide us
          any account-related information to download or use our products.
          Additionally, if you make a payment using a credit or debit card
          through the Services, your Personal Information will be collected by a
          third-party payment provider and not by us. If you make a payment via
          PayPal, or in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, payments are
          processed by those third parties, and will be subject to the third
          party's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. It probably
          goes without saying, but well say it anyway. If you contact us
          directly, we may receive additional Personal Information about you.
          For example, when you contact customer support, we receive the
          contents of messages or attachments that you send to us, and other
          information you choose to provide.
        </p>

          Personal Information We Collect Automatically When You Use The
          Services
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you download the Humble VPN app, connect to the Humble VPN, or visit our websites, we and our third party service providers
          collect information about you or your device automatically. Here's a
          fuller explanation of the types of Personal Information collected when
          you use our Services:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>
            When you launch the Humble VPN app, before you connect to the
            VPN, we and our service providers collect device-specific
            information, such as the unique mobile ID, hardware model, operating
            system version, language, and network information. We may also use,
            but never log or store, your IP address to derive your approximate
            (city-level) location. We use this information to provide and
            improve the Services, troubleshoot and perform analytics on our
            services. Our service providers may collect IP addresses for
            marketing attribution purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you connect to the Humble VPN, we collect your IP address,
            immediately encrypt it and store it only for the duration of your
            VPN session. Your IP address is deleted after you disconnect from
            the VPN. We do not associate your IP address with your online
            activities and we do not store or log your IP address after you
            disconnect from the VPN.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not attribute any specific website visits or app usage to any
            specific user. We do not keep logs of your online activities and
            never associate any domains or applications that you use with you,
            your device, or email. Websites visited via our servers are
            aggregated and stored to: (1) Perform analytics on our services,
            including measuring whether our users, in aggregate, are able to
            successfully access certain websites or apps; (2) Troubleshoot
            service issues and improve service quality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When You Visit Our Websites</h2>
        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>
            We and our third party service providers and partners (e.g. Google
            Analytics, Maxmind) may automatically collect information from your
            device, sometimes by placing cookies, beacons, and similar
            technologies in your browser and on emails that we send you. We may
            use this information, for example, to ensure that the website
            functions properly, to determine how many users have visited certain
            pages or opened messages or newsletters, or to prevent fraud. If you
            do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there
            is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to
            automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or
            accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or

        <p>
          If you are located in the European Economic Area, we only process your
          Personal Information based on a valid legal ground, including:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>
            When we need your Personal Information to provide our services,

            If you otherwise consent to the processing of your Personal

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>
          We only share your Personal Information as described in this privacy
          policy in order to provide and improve the Services, facilitate a
          merger or sale of our business, or if required to do so by law. As
          stated above, we do not log your browsing data and we delete your IP
          address when you disconnect from the VPN. Here are some more specifics
          on whom we share your information with and why:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-content__list">
          <li>
            To our third party service providers who provide services such as
            website hosting, payment processing, data analysis, information
            technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service,
            email delivery, fraud prevention, online advertising, auditing, and
            other services.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you launch the Humble VPN app, we may also use your IP
            address, which we automatically delete after you disconnect from the
            VPN, to derive your approximate (city-level) location. When you are
            connected to the Humble VPN, advertisers are prevented from
            seeing your IP address, however if you are using the free version of
            Humble VPN we may share this approximate (city-level) location.
            If you are using the premium Humble VPN Premium version this
            approximate city- level location will not be collected and will not
            be shared.
          </li>
          <li>
            To a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of
            any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment,
            transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business,
            assets or stock (including in bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
          </li>
          <li>
            Again, we do not require you to provide us with any contact
            information in order to download or use our VPN product, we do not
            log or store your IP address after you disconnect from the VPN, and
            we do not keep logs on your online activities. Therefore, we
            generally do not have Personal Information to share with law
            enforcement and generally do not have the data to provide in
            response to law enforcement requests. You can read our Transparency
            Report for more information on our responses to laW enforcement
            requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, we may share what Personal Information we do have if
            required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
            action is appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws
            outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process;
            © to respond to requests from public and government authorities,
            including public and government authorities outside your country of
            residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect
            our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our
            nghts, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates,
            you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or
            limit the damages that we may sustain.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you use the Premium version of Humble VPN no information is
          shared with advertisers. We may use and disclose aggregate information
          that does not identify or otherwise relate to an individual for any
          purpose, unless We are prohibited from doing so under applicable law.
        </p>

          traffic is being sent to and from our servers. We also maintain
